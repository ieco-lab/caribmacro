# Caribbean Macrosystems

The associated R package is still being formed and used with unpulblished data. If you want access to the package or the raw data please contact the author [Jason M. Gleditsch](mailto:jason.gleditsch@temple.edu) or author [Matthew R. Helmus](mailto:mrhelmus@temple.edu).

Most recently associated publication is [Gleditsch et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13623).

## Description

The Caribbean Macrosystems project aims to better understand the processes that shape the biodiveristy of the Caribbean bioregion. Further, we seek to describe how the anthropogenic movement of species alters the biogeographic relationships of the Caribbean and community assembly. 

In order to do this, we have broken up the Caribbean Macrosystems project into four smaller projects each with the goal of answering important questions about island biogeography thoery, drivers of beta-diversity, species coexistence, and the role of economic factors in the spread of species.


## How to prepare your R for the analyses

In order to run the analyses for this project you will need to install the following packages for data manipulation, the use of biodiversity databases, spatial analyses, phylogenetic analyses, statistical analyses, and graphing.

Data Manipulation Packages
```
install.packages(c('here', 'reshape', 'readr'))
```

Biodiversity Packages
```
install.packages(c('rgbif', 'taxize')) 
```

Spatial Analysis Packages
```
install.packages(c('rgeos', 'rgdal', 'sf'))
```

Phylogenetic Anlysis Packages
```
install.packages(c('ape', 'phyr'))
```

Statistical Analysis Packages
```
install.packages(c('FactoMineR', 'MuMIn', 'AICcmodavg'))
```

Graphing Packages
```
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'gridExtra', 'ggpubr'))

```


# How to reproduce this analysis

You can find the `caribmacro` package on git at:
```
git clone git@gitlab.com:jmg5214/caribmacro.git
```
However, the git repository is not yet up and running. Therefore, in order to reproduce this analysis contact Dr. Mathew Helmus at the Temple University Center for Biodiversity for access to the caribmacro package materials.
